### Introduction

We studied how the relationship between digital technology use and well-being has changed over time using three representative large datasets. We used the following key variables from the datasets

- Monitoring the Future (MTF)
  - TV viewing and social media use
  - Rosenberg self-esteem scale (mean of 6 items); Bentler Medical & Psychological Functioning Inventory (mean of six depression items); MtF Loneliness scale (mean of six items)
- Understanding Society (US)
  - TV viewing, social media use, and gaming (console and computer)
  - Rosenberg self-esteem scale (mean of 8 items); Strengths & weaknesses questionnaire (mean of items); Subjective well-being GHQ scale (mean of 12 items); SF-12 mental and physical health (mean of 7 items); Satisfaction scale (mean of six items)
- Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)
  - TV viewing and digital device use
  - 4 suicidal ideation items and 1 item about sad/hopelessness (mean of these 5 binary items)

**We recoded all well-being items such that greater values indicate greater well-being (e.g. greater depression values indicate lower depression). Analyses were restricted to individuals 15 years old or younger.**

### Key findings

- Large decline in TV viewing with a corresponding increase in social media and device use
- On average, technology use variables were negatively related to wellbeing outcomes, but the relations were small and varied over studies, years, and outcomes/predictors
- Some technology variables were becoming more positively associated with wellbeing over time, some more negatively, and some were more stable

# Results {.storyboard}

### Monitoring the Future

```{r}
plot_data(
  mtf, 
  variables = c(tv, social_media, self_esteem, depression, loneliness)
) %>% 
  ggplotly(tooltip = c("text")) %>% 
  style(hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = "white"))
```

***

- The average well-being variables showed signs of decline over time 
- Decline in TV viewing but a large uptick in social media use

### Understanding Society

```{r}
plot_data(
  us,
  c(tv, social_media, self_esteem, sdq)
) %>% 
  ggplotly(tooltip = c("text")) %>% 
  style(hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = "white"))
```

***

- Declines in well-being metrics (if any) were less prominent than in MtF (but note shorter sampling frame)
- TV viewing declined over time whereas social media use had increased
- Something odd in scsf and tv viewing, needs to be looked in to

### Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System

```{r}
plot_data(
  yrbs,
  c(sad_lonely:device)
) %>% 
  ggplotly(tooltip = c("text")) %>% 
  style(hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = "white"))
```

***

- The numbered suicide items are basically in increasing order of severity
- Again, declines (if any) in wellbeing were less prominent than in MTF
- Increase in digital device use and decline in TV viewing

### Technology effects over time

```{r}

        as_tibble() %>% 
        mutate(year = year + 2010)
    )
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r}

  unnest(coef_linear) %>% 
  filter(term == "x:year") %>% 
  mutate(
    interaction = glue("b[x*year]*10 = {round(estimate*10, 2)}, p = {round(p.value, 4)}")

  mutate(year = lubridate::ymd(year, truncated = 2)) %>% 
  # Create nicer labels
  mutate(sp = glue("{study}: {outcome} ~ {predictor}")) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      year, x.trend, ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL, 
      col = sex, fill = sex, group = sex
    )

```

***

We first fitted an ordinary linear regression model separately for each of the standardized well-being outcomes ($y$) and standardized technology use variables ($x$) in each study. The model predicted the outcome from the technology use variable, and its interaction with year (`lm(y ~ x * year)`). We treated year as a categorical variable to obtain estimates of the technology effects for each year. 

- The effects were mostly negative and small
- In the MTF data, effects (particularly on loneliness) were becoming more positive over time

Then, we fitted a model where year was treated as a continuous variable, in order to estimate the linear change of technology effects over time (the interaction term between year and predictor).

- Device use was becoming more positively predictive of two suicidal ideation items, but more negatively for three others
- Gaming was becoming more positively predictive of satisfaction and strengths&weaknesses
- Social media results were mixed; in the MtF data relations were becoming more positive, whereas the US interaction estimates were both negative and positive
- TV viewing was becoming more positively predictive of wellbeing in the MTF data, with more mixed results in the US dataset (but note similar estimated magnitudes for self esteem), and little to no consistent change was indicated in the YRBS dataset
